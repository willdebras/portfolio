This website was one of the first simple scenes I built to practice Three.js after completing Bruno Simon's Three.js Journey course. This small scene of a cyberpunk-esque city was built and lit in Blender. The scene was UV unwrapped and the textures were processed and baked to be used in Three.js

In Three.js, simple controls were added. Fans for the air conditioning were animated, and a particle generator was built to create the smoke effect out of the vents on top of the building.


The experience is live and deployed on [Vercel](https://cyber-city.vercel.app).
