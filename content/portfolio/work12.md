SHR STR was built for a CalArts Visual Elements of User Interface Design course. "Shore Store" is a mockup mobile application to help Chicagoans find food near the Lake Shore. It was primarily designed in Figma.

SHR STR served as the final mockup for the CalArts Visual Elements of User Interface Design course. It features two mocked UIs of a mobile aplication, one for a main page and one for a leaflet.js map that a user could use to find food near them.

The color scheme was designed to blend the attractive components of Chicago beaches--the sunset, the sand at Montrose, the blue skies--and the color and texture of the rugged concrete blocks that run along the water.

Default, hover, and active/focused state buttons were mocked up in Codepen to showcase user feedback in these styles. Additional icons for a color palette were also mocked up.

The main screen features a mockup for a leaflet.js map with markets to locate restaurants and food.
