SHR STR was built for a CalArts Visual Elements of User Interface Design course. "Shore Store" is a mocked mobile application to help Chicagoans find food near the Lake Shore. It was primarily designed in Figma.

SHR STR features two mocked UIs of a mobile aplication, one for a main page and one for a leaflet.js map that a user could use to find food near them.

The color scheme was designed to blend the attractive components of Chicago beaches--the sunset, the sand at Montrose, the blue skies--and the color and texture of the rugged concrete blocks that run along the water.

Default, hover, and active/focused state buttons were mocked up in Codepen to showcase user feedback in these styles. Additional icons for a color palette were also mocked up.

The main screen features a mockup for a leaflet.js map and a design for potential markers.
