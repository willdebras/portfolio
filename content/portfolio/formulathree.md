The site features the use of scrollTrigger to pin and unpin canvas elements, uses gsap.to and gsap.toFrom to update the canvas, and toggleClass to provide transitions with the scroll of the page page. It also features many interesting Three.js features including attractive lighting and environment mapping, utilizing a LoadingManger to create a progress bar, and tweening of cameras with GSAP animations.
