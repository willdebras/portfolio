This infographic was created during my work at NORC as a client deliverable for Harbor Freight Tools for Schools, featuring survey data from three surveys on vocational education in the United States amongst parents, students, and voters.

This one-pager infographic showcases work throughout a full project lifecycle in my job. I aided in collection of data through the development of a survey questionnaire with a client, to the analysis and report writing, and the development of a full infographic. The piece was created with a mix of tools. It features plots createed in R {ggplot2}, icons that were trimmed and edited in MS powerpoint, and a final deliverable pieced together and touched up in Adobe Illustrator.
