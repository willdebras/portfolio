Spring Nights was an experiment in design, developed to creatively display a palette of colors to be used in another work. It's a self contained interactive website, allowing a user to click on elements of an eye shadow palette and read more about the color in question.

The website was created as an example of how one could showcase colors for a project scheme in an interesting, interactive way. It was created by binding inputs to SVG elements with simple jQuery functions and adding CSS to make each swatch feel clickable. It mainly features satirical descriptions for colors that might exist in a strange, dystopian, alternate-reality eye shadow palette.
