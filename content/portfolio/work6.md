A pair of partner visualisations created for the UChicago Divinity School depicts the extent various religious (and non-religious) groups view threats to their own and others' religious freedoms.

This set of visualisations was created for an AP-NORC report in partnership with the University of Chicago Divinity School on views of religious freedom. The first visualisation shows how different groups view others' freedoms as being threatened.

> The visualisation exemplifies how large percentages of Americans feel that the rights of Jews and Muslims are threatened, however, these views differ by groups. Atheist and agnostic respondents are more likely to see Muslims’ (70%), Jews’ (53%), and their fellow atheists’ (45%) freedom of religion being challenged, but are less likely to see Evangelical Christians’ (8%) and other Christians’ (8%) freedom of religion threatened. Protestants are also most likely to see Muslims’ and Jews’ freedom threatened, but they are more likely to see the freedom of Evangelicals and other Christians threatened compared to atheists and agnostics.

The second visualisation depicts the perception of threat of other religious groups.

> One can see that a majority of Atheists feel that evangelical Christians threaten the religious freedom of others, while a minority of other groups agree. White Evangelical Christians are less likely than other Americans to say the claims of Catholics (8% vs. 21%) and other Christians’ (12% vs. 24%) threaten others’ rights. They are also are less likely to say their own (15% vs. 27%) claims threaten the rights of others.
