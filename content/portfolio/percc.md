Working with Ensemble Media, I was contracted to make various dashboards for the Population Council displaying an attractive UI to generate various data visualizations showcasing modeled estimates of population, urbanization, and migration under various climate scenarios.

I helped provide consulting on design and visualization, buit various interfaces in R Shiny, and created unique visualizations in the highcharts, plotly, and leaflet libraries. I also helped to configure a server for the hosting of the applications.


The website was presented at the UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) at https://cdm.popcouncil.org/
